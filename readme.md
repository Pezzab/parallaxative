#Parallaxative *

This is a no frills parallax effect plugin to be applied to multi-layered CSS backgrounds

[Demo here](http://pointatthemoon.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/parallaxative/)

Features I'm aiming for:

* aim to add some basic animation - ie pngs could conceivably be made to move in circular motions
* to be easily customisable
* parallax effects could also be triggered by hover or click events
* currently requires all three layers - will eventually work with two. Just one seems silly
* needs funkier demo images

##Acknowledgements:

My starting point for this code comes from:

* [CrocoDillon](http://codepen.io/CrocoDillon/pen/ukotd)
* [Jonathon Nicol](http://jonathannicol.com/blog/2011/08/06/build-a-parallax-scrolling-website-interface-with-jquery-and-css)
