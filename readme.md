#Parallaxative *

This is a no frills parallax effect plugin to be applied to multi-layered CSS backgrounds

Features I'm aiming for:

* if background-position/s are set the plugin should accomodate these
* aim to add some basic animation - ie pngs could conceivably be made to move in circular motions
* to be easily customisable
* parallax effects could also be triggered by hover or click events

##Acknowledgements:

My starting point for this code comes from:
